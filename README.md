I made this project to learn how to make API calls through the ***Alamofire*** framework, imported through **CocoaPods**. 

In addition, to make the project more interesting, I also used the ***Charts*** framework through which you can make nice and useful charts in order to have a statistical data.

The project is also structured following the MVVM design pattern.
